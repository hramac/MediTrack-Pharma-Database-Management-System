# MediTrack-Pharma-Database-Management-System
### A Pharmacy Database Management System

The pharmaceutical industry is a vital component of healthcare, responsible for the research,
development, and production of drugs and medicines. However, managing the vast amount of
data related to drug information, clinical trials, patient data, and manufacturing information
poses a significant challenge for the industry. To address these challenges, the industry requires a
pharma database management system to streamline data management, enhance data security, and
ensure compliance with regulations.

This project aims to develop a database management system called ‘MediTrack’ that can store
and retrieve information about drugs, patient prescriptions, and medication orders. MediTrack
will serve as a central repository for all data related to the pharmacy, including customer
information, inventory details, medication information, and sales transactions. The goal is to
create a system that caters to the day-to-day requirements of the pharmacy, ensuring safety,
accuracy, and efficiency and providing a competitive advantage to the pharmacy. This report
outlines the process of designing and implementing the MediTrack database management system
and its features, benefits, and potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry.
